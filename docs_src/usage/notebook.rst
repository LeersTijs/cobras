========
An example on how to run COBRAS for time series clustering using a jupyter notebook can be found in ``examples/COBRAS_notebook_timeseries.ipynb``.
An example for image clustering can be found in ``examples/COBRAS_notebook_images.ipynb``.
In these examples, queries and results are plotted directly in the notebook and user feedback is given through the notebook prompt.
